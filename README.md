# WorldOfYoutube-WebApp

## Overview
The World Of Youtube WebApp is the same as the [Android app ](https://github.com/Mikerah/WorldOfYoutube) I built a few months ago. This version of the app was built using the Django Web Framework for Python, Bootstrap 3 and the Youtube Data API. This project was for me to learn more about the Django framework and to decide whether to puruse web development more seriously. Overall, this project was fun to pursue and has made me want to pursue web development work more seriously.

## What I've learned
For this project, I learned the Django web project and learned more about Bootstrap3. I've learned more about the web development process and gained a better understanding of how my favorite web apps work. I've also learned how to incorporate an API in a web application. I can now incorporate the Youtube Data API in both Python and Java projects. I've also solidified my understanding of the web and how the internet works in general. This knowledge includes the difference between GET and POST request and how Django renders urls.

## Improvements
As always, there are a lot of improvements to be made in every single one of my projects. The main area where this project needs improvements is in the web design department. This site looks like it came out of the 90s. As opposed to having 2 html files, this web app could be a single page application. The design of the code could be improved upon as well. I left certain functions in the views.py file even though they weren't views, simply for easier access. And then there are the typical things that I mention in every learning project like exception handling and documentation.

###### API KEY
Since I have been having difficulty removing my API KEY from this repository's commit history, I have revoked the API KEY and left them in this code. Thus, if you fork this repo, you'll have to create your own Youtube Data v3 API KEY.
