# WorldOfYoutube-WebApp

## Overview
The World Of Youtube WebApp is the same as the [Android app ](https://github.com/Mikerah/WorldOfYoutube) I built a few months ago. This version of the app was built using the Django Web Framework for Python and Bootstrap 3. This project was for me to learn more about the Django framework and to decide whether to puruse web development more seriously. Overall, this project was fun to pursue and has made me want to pursue web development work more seriously.

## Improvements
As always, there are a lot of improvements to be made in every single one of my projects. The main area where this project needs improvements is in the web design department. This site looks like it came out of the 90s. As opposed to having 2 html files, this web app could be a single page application. The design of the code could be improved upon as well. I left certain functions in the views.py file even though they weren't views, simply for easier access. And then there are the typical things that I mention in every learning project like exception handling and documentation.
